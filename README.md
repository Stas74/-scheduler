# Interview Scheduler

This application helps you to book an interview for a free spot on a selected day. It is only necessary to choose a student and an interviewer.
Additional options: delete the selected interview, edit the selected interview (select a new student and/or interviewer). All of these options have a confirmation window for the user.
